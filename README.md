```

---

#### styledText
* styledText. Usege:
``` Kotlin
styledText("Hello, World!", Colors.blue)
```
  - Some problems with it geting long when using multiple attributes. <br>
  Like this:
``` Kotlin
styledText("Hello, World!", Colors.blue + Colors.backgroundCyan + Colors.bold + Colors.italic + Colors.underline)
```
<br>
And it lack the functionality of selecting where in the text the colors should apply

### Stability
The condition is simply 游릴 for working as intended and easy to work with, <br>
游댰 for bit jancky or challenging to work with, but no high security risico, <br>
and 游댮 for broken, not working or hard to work with, and or high security risico.

| Feature | Stability | Condition |
| ----------- | :-----------: | :--: |
| styled_text() | Unstable | 游릴 / 游댰 |
| color_generator | Stable | 游릴 |
| throw_exception() | Unstable | 游릴 |

### Todo
- [ ] Refine styledText with better selection compatability and easier implementation of multiple color attributes.
- [ ] Refine the Colors class to be easier to use, and multiple pick using + or something.
- [ ] Make it a library. (Don't know how yet, I'll fix it when I need to)
- [ ] Started project
- [x] Add README.md
